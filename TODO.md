# Todo List


### Preprocessing 

- Write a function that runs exploreHyperparsRange(X,y,args)
  for each dataset and for each variable to predict
  
  The output should be a suitable range of Cs to explore in further
  performance assessments
  
  Otherwise we could run the analysis for a number of datasets
  and variables and see if a common Cs is possible for all, 
  producing plots


### Improve implementation with pipelines

- Done
